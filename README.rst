Django Data Importer
====================

This tool makes importing tabular data into Django databases a snap, especially where the data is (or should be relational), allowing for multiple passes (and parses) over the same file extracting different information per run - without having to alter the data or its structure in anyway.

At the moment it only supports CSVs, but support for Excel files might come eventually.
